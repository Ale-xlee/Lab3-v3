# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?

long format consists of each column as a variable, with rows as observations,
wide format is when an data is when there is one observation row per subject,
with each measurement as a variable.

Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?

wide format

How many observations are there in the data set?

11 observations


## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("1975","1989","1993","1999","2001","2003","2005"
             ,"2007","2009","2011"),
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "percent"    )


```


## Exercise 3

```{r dot-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 3 here

ggplot(data = staff_long, mapping = aes( x = year,
                                         y = percent,
                                         color = faculty_type)) +
  geom_point()



```

## Exercise 4

```{r bad-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 4 here

ggplot(data = staff_long, mapping = aes(x = year,
                                        y = percent,
                                        color = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()
```

## Exercise 5

```{r mutate-year}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

staff_long <- staff_long %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))




# Write your code for Exercise 5 here

ggplot(data=staff_long, mapping = aes(x = year,
                                      y = percent,
                                      color = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()
```

```

## Exercise 6

```{r better-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 6 here

ggplot(data = staff_long, mapping = aes(x = year, 
   y = percent,
   color = faculty_type)) + geom_line() + 
   labs(title = "Proportion of Faculty over the years", 
   color = "Faculty Type",
   x ="Years",
   y = "Proportion of staff")


```

## Exercise 7

_Write below your ideas for adapting the line plot_

* mutate new variablefro all full time employees
* specify the color as either full time or partime
* Highlight part Time
* ...


## Exercise 8

```{r implement-Ex7}
# Write your code for Exercise 8 here

staff_long <- staff_long %>%
  mutate( part_time = 
  case_when( faculty_type == "Part_Time Faculty" ~ "Part-Time Faculty",
    TRUE ~ "Other Faculty Types"))

ggplot(data = staff_long, 
 mapping = aes(x = year,
               y =  percent,
               group = faculty_type,
               color = part_time)) + 
 geom_line() + scale_color_manual(values = c("gray","red"))
 labs(title = "Instructional Staff Employment Trends, 1975-2011",
  x = "Years", 
  y = "Proportion of staff")
```
